Getting Started!
======================================
**Thank you for your interest in the Map Viewer.  This application was intended to be very user friendly and allow users to freely explore the map data and layers.** 

    Upon loading the application you will be presented with an empty map which you can zoom and pan easily on any modern device or machine.
	
The main functions
------------------

-  `Adding and viewing data to the map`_
-  `Animating layers that include time`_
-  `Changing base map to better view your specific layer set`_
-  `Working with the data`_
-  `More info`_


Adding and viewing data to the map
----------------------------------
	Adding layers to the map is super easy!  Start by clicking the menu link that says **Data Layers**.  
	When the side panel opens you will have many layers to choose from that you may add to or remove from the map by checking or unchecking the box.  
	Each layer you add will be placed on top of all layers currently on the map.  If you would like to bring a layer to the top simply uncheck it
	and recheck it.  After the layer is checked and added to the map you will notice a slider control under the name in the list.
	That slider is to control the opacity of the layer on the map.  
	
Animating layers that include time
----------------------------------
	If you selected a layer with time enabled you will also see a timeline control added to the bottom of the map.  
	You may scroll and pan the timeline to select a date range to animate. Hit the play button to play the animation the date range you have 
	set in the timeline.  Use the pause, forward, and back buttons to control the animation. Click on any date to go directly there.
	If you have more that one animated layer on the map at the same time only the layer selected in the timeslider dropdown will animate, 
	the other layers below will remain at the date they were prior to selecting a different one. 
	
Changing base map to better view your specific layer set
--------------------------------------------------------
	Basemaps add a framework onto which you add the research data layer.  The base map is used for locational reference as well as design contrast
	to help view your data.  Depending on the dataset that you are looking at one base map may be a better choice to see the intricate details
	that the data provides.  That being the case we offer several base maps to choose from by clicking the **Base Maps** tab.

Working with the data
---------------------
	While the Map Viewer is not intended to be a full range analysis tool it does provide a small set of data tools that you can use to get information
	about the data.  Click on the **Data Tools** tab and you will see the tools in the side panel.  The first tool is a Get Info tool which gets all the data provided for 
	a point that you click.  The info is returned for the top layer only, if you would like info for a different layer you will need to move it to the top.
	
	The second tool is a `ClimateSERV <https://climateserv.servirglobal.net/>`_ tool.  It allows you to select an area of interest by drwaing a polygon, selecting a feature on the map, or uploading 
	a geojson with a geometery defined inside.  Once you select your area of intertest you choose if you want to run the analysis on a dataset or if you would 
	like the monthly rainfall analysis data.  If you choose the monthly rainfall analysis there are no other options and you can simply click **Submit Job**
	If you choose datasets you can then select the data source.  Some data sources have custom options but they are all pretty user friendly and easy to understand.
